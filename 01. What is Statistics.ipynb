    "# What is Statistics?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodological** subject encompassing all aspects of **learning from data**. \n",
    "* **tools and methods** to allow us to work with and understanding data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statisticians** apply and develop data analysis method, seek to understand their properties...\n",
    "* ... when do these tools provide **insights**?\n",
    "* ... when are they possibly **misleading**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Researchers** and **workers** apply and extend statistical methodology and contribute new ideas and methods for conducting data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A \"Statistic\" and the field of \"Statistics\"\n",
    "* A **statistic** ~ numerical or graphical summary of a collection of data.\n",
    "    * Averange score on final exam\n",
    "    * Minimum temperature at a location over year\n",
    "    * Proportion of people who are retired\n",
    "* **Statistics** ~ academic discipline focusing on research methodology. Statisticians develop new statistical tools, calculate statistics from data, and collaborate with subject-matter experts to interpret them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Landscape of Statistics\n",
    "Evolving and dynamic field ~ Emerging **Challenges** and **opportunities**\n",
    "* **Properties** of statistical methods are under **continuing study**\n",
    "* New application areas -> **development** of new analytic methods\n",
    "* New types of sensors -> **new types of data**\n",
    "* Advances in **computing** -> sophisticated analyses on Big Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perspectives on Statistical Science\n",
    "Statistics is a **\"big tent\"** discipline ~ incorporates new ideas from theory, practice, allied fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different Perspectives:\n",
    "* \"art of summarizing data\"\n",
    "* \"science of uncertainty\"\n",
    "* \"science of decisions\"\n",
    "* \"science of variation\"\n",
    "* \"art of forecasting\"\n",
    "* \"science of measurement\"\n",
    "* \"basis for principled data collection\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics as the \"art of summarizing data\"\n",
    "* Data can be **overwhelming**\n",
    "* Making sense of data usually involves **reduction** and **summarization**\n",
    "    * **reduction**: make a dataset **comprehensible** to human observer.\n",
    "    * **summarization**: always **depends primarily on goals of \"data consumer\"** to be meaningful -- many approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics as the \"science of uncertainty\"\n",
    "* Data can be **misleading**\n",
    "* Statistics provides framework for **assessing whether claims based on data are meaningful**\n",
    "* Uncertainty is inevitable, but it is highly desirable to **quantify how far out reported finding may fall from \"the truth**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many public opinion polls report **+- margin of error**\n",
    "-> potential discrepancy between reported and actual states of public opinion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics as the \"science of decisions\"\n",
    "* Understanding data is important -> only consequential if we act on what we have learned\n",
    "* **Decision-making** = ultimate goal of any statistical analysis\n",
    "* We **make decisions in face of uncertainly!** What are costs and benefits of different approaches?\n",
    "\n",
    "-> at higher than average risk for cancer... should they undergo preventative procedure?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics as the \"science of variation\"\n",
    "* Often focus on most typical or **\"central\"** value\n",
    "* Great emphasis on understanding **variation** in data!\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Average American has around $6000 of credit card debt => central value of credit card debt in US population.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> 10% of Americans have more than $30,000 in credit card debt -> variation of credit card debt in US population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics as the \"art of forecasting\"\n",
    "* Forecasting or prediction = central tasks in statistics\n",
    "* **Cannot** know future with absolute certainly, but efficient use of available data\n",
    "\n",
    "-> **can** sometimes make accurate predictions about future\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics as the \"science of measurement\"\n",
    "* **High accuracy:** person's age or height\n",
    "* **More difficult:** blood pressure (varies minute to minute)\n",
    "* **Harder:** \"mood\", \"political ideology\", \"personalitt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistics:** major role in **constructing and evaluating rigorous approaches for measuring difficult-to-define concepts** and in **assessing quality.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistics as the \"basis for principled data collection\"\n",
    "* Data often expensive and difficult to collect\n",
    "* Resource limitations -> collect least data possible\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistics:** provides a rational way to manage this trade-off"
