    "\n",
    "### Data can be Numbers\n",
    "* National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n",

    "# Where Do Data Come From?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Different Types of Data\n",
    "#### Two Key types of data:\n",
    "* Organic / Process Data.\n",
    "* \"Designed\" Data Collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organic / Process Data\n",
    "#### Examples:\n",
    "* Financial or Point-of-sale transactions/Stock market exchanges.\n",
    "* Netflix viewing history.\n",
    "* Web browser activity.\n",
    "* Temperature/pollution cusors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theses processes generate massive quantities of data => **\"Big Data\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g., baseball games, meals ordered at McDonald's on given day, changes in temperature on a given day in particular city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing requires significant computational resources; **data scientists \"mine\"** these data to study trends and uncover interesting relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### \"Designed\" Data Collection\n",
    "Designed to specifically address a stated research objective\n",
    "* Individuals sampled from a population, interviewed about from a population interviewed about opinions on a particular topic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common features of \"designed\" data\n",
    "* Sampling from populations, administration of carefully designed questions.\n",
    "* Typically data sets much smaller compared to organic/process data sets.\n",
    "* Data collected for very specific reasons, rather than simple reflections of ongoing natural process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are the Data i.i.d.?\n",
    "For analyzing data, ragardless of source, an important question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Can the Data be considered **i.i.d.?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**i = independent and id = identically distributed**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Final exam scores** from a large Into to Stats class at a university are **independent observations** from a **common normal distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What if Data are NOT i.i.d.?\n",
    "Examples\n",
    "* Students sitting next to each other tend to have similar scores.\n",
    "* Males and females might have different means.\n",
    "* Students from same discussion section may have similar scores.\n",
    "Dependencies and diffenrences need to be accounted for in analysis! \n",
    "-> Need different analytic procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "* Need to Ask:\n",
    "-> Can we can apply procedures that **assume i.i.d. data?**\n",
    "* Always **consider where data came from!**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Variable Types\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantitative Variables\n",
    "* Numerical, measurable quantities in which arithmetic operations often make sense.\n",
    "* Continuous - could take on any value within an interval, many possible values.\n",
    "* Discrete - countable value, finite number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "* Although age is reported as an integer, it can be modeled as a continuous variable\n",
    "* Age (a quantitative variable) can be transformed into a categorical variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Categorical (or Qualitative) Variables\n",
    "* Classifies individuals or items into different groups.\n",
    "* Ordinal - groups have an order or ranking.\n",
    "* Nominal - groups are merely names, no ranking."
